# Business Analytics Seminar: Urban Air Mobility - Optimizing Flight Altitude based on surrounding Noise Pollution

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has become a topic of great importance in recent
years as a new method of air transportation. Due to the traffic congestion found in
major cities, such as New York, flying vehicles could act as a compliment to our usual
day to day transportation methods. With the huge advancements in technology,
several companies were able to forecast how these vehicles would look like. Adding to
that, companies like Uber, NASA, Boeing, and many others have in fact created their
own concepts of these vehicles. However, there are still many challenges that face
the launching of UAMs. One of the main challenges is the noise emissions generated
by these vehicles. Noise emissions has been a key factor to the adoption of UAMs by
several cities and governments. The code uploaded discusses how VTOL vehicles, travelling from a
start to an end location in Germany, can adjust its flying altitude based on the noise
pollution of the area or region it is flying above. The motivation of this code is to
determine a reasonable flight altitude for VTOL vehicles so that they do not affect
the surrounding communities.
